Weather Dashboard

This application allows users to input a city name into a search.  Information on the weather in that particular city is returned, including the 5-day forecast, temperature, windspeed, and UV Index.  
The user's search is saved by using Local Storage and the user is presented with their most recent search when re-opening the application.
I used OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities.


Usage

To use this applicaton, the user can enter the name of the city that they would like weather information about.  Once entering in the city name, the user can click on the search button.  Once clicking on the search button, the 5-day forecast for the inputted city will populate.
